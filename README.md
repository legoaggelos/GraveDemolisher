Grave Demolisher   
      
In this game, you demolish graves.    
That is it.    
Demolish as many as you can.    
      
1.0 (initial release) was made in 2 weeks.    
It is probably filled with bugs.     
The 1.0 jar works on windows.    
Not on linux.    
Can't confirm if it works on MacOS.    
I will make it work on linux too. Soon. There are also a lot of more things I want to add, just not soon.    
      
This game is inspired by "Grave Puncher", a game in the show Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja.     
     
This was made with javafx 22 and java 22.     
      
Minimum requirements will come with linux suport.   
     
Have fun!
