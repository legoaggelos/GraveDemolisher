Grave Demolisher   
      
In this game, you demolish graves.    
That is it.    
Demolish as many as you can.    
      
1.0 (initial release) was made in 2 weeks.    
It is probably filled with bugs.     
The 1.0 jar works on windows.    
Not on linux.    
Can't confirm if it works on MacOS.    
I will make it work on linux too. Soon. There are also a lot of more things I want to add, just not soon.    
      
This game is inspired by "Grave Puncher", a game in the show Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja.     
     
This was made with javafx 22 and java 22.     
      
Minimum requirements will come with linux suport.   

If you encounter any bugs add them as an issue!
     
Have fun!    

Note: I know the code is not very good. I tried my best. If you want to comment on it, please say it in a kind way and say what I did wrong/in a bad way and how I would do it in a better way. Please do not just say something like "your code is bad" or "your main class is beyond cooked"(real example).
